Easybank project take 3:

What I learned:

1) Embedding SVG images to the html doc:
There are 4 ways:
- Inline: Directly adding the svg code to the html doc
- <object type="image/svg+xml" data="svgURL" width="svgWidth" height="svgheight" title="descriptive name"></object>: This method allows you to manipulate the svg element's properties. This method is prefered because object is an html standard tag, hence it is supported by all browsers.
- <embed></embed>: Similar to object, but it is not widely supported
- <svg><use></use></svg>: This works if a single path or g tag  is used to create the svg element. If the svg has multiple paths, it can still work, but it is tedious.

In this project, I used the object tag.

However, the cursor:pointer property does not work on the object tag. That's why for icons that do need to be modified like the logo, I simply used the image tag


2) Loading images
- To improve the performance, set the loading attribute to lazy
- Add a much smaller image of the original image as a background (this is to prevent the loading from top to bottom we sometimes see when the connection is slow)
- Use the following css properties
background-size: cover
background-position: center

- As for the actual image
object-fit:cover;
object-position: center;

By matching the background and the image, they will perfectly overlap making for a smooth load.
